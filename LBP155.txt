A company wishes to modify the technique by which tasks in the processing queue are executed. There are N processes with unique ID's from 0 to N-1. Each of these tasks has its own execution time. The company wishes to implement a new algorithm for processing tasks. for this purpose they have identified a value K by the new algorithm, the processor will first process the task that has the Kth shortest execution time.
Write an algorithm to find the Kth shortest execution time.

Input Format

array size, k value and array

Constraints

NA

Output Format

kth shortest execution time.
