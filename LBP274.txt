Implement the following function
def NextLetter(ch1,ch2);
The function accepts two characters ch1 and ch2 as arguments, ch1 and ch2 are alphabetical letters. Implement the function to find and return the next letter so that distance between ch2 and the next letter is the same as the distance between ch1 and ch2. While counting distance if you exceed thhe letter 'z' then, count the remaining distance starting from the letter 'a'.

Distance between two letters is the number of letters between them.
